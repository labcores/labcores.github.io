	<p>The Lab CORES is organized broadly into working groups including: </p>
	<center><img src="/images/site-structure/cores-areas.png" width="640" height="410" /></center>
	<ul>
		<li><h1>Domains</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><h2>Urban Centers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Scenario that characterizes applications and solutions aimed at solving problems and creating facilities in urban centers.
							<p>Topics: Smart Cities, Crowdsensing, Opportunistic collaborations(opportunistic sensing, opportunistic networks), Urban mobility
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Science / Academy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Scenario featuring applications and solutions geared to academia and scientific research. It mainly includes researches focused on analyzing scientific production, technologies and products, as well as the interaction between scenario and society.
							<p>Topics: Scientometrics (metrics on science and production), Altmetrics (Alternative metrics that aim to quantify other aspects of science, eg impact on the population), Tech mining, Big scholar data (Techniques for application in massive academic data)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><H1>Areas</H1>
			<ul>
				<li><h2>Intelligent Ecosystems</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Research area dedicated to the development of models, techniques and computational practices focused on intelligent ecosystems. An ecosystem is a metaphor used to represent collaborative arrangements in constant evolution. These communities have autonomous entities with distinct purposes, creating a complex network of relationships for coexistence.
							<p>Through social computing resources, different kinds of intelligent ecosystems are analyzed, such as entrepreneurial communities, software development, innovation organizations, and smart cities. Among other purposes, the researches aim to systematize the decision-making process and improve the mechanisms of knowledge management, transparency, and resilience of these environments.
							<p><h3>Research Topics:</h3>Education, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Knowledge Management, Decision Support Systems, Emergency, Governance, Team Formation, Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Sensing and Monitoring</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Sector responsible for analyzing data sets of social networks in order to understand phenomena of different domains as to their origin, transmissibility and content, as well as their impact on society. The main elements of a social network are entities (which can represent people, IoT elements, etc.), and the relationships (which can represent relations of friendship, connections etc.) between those entities.
							<p>Topics: Social IoT, Data origin, Multiple Source Data, Semantic Sensor Network, Rumors Identification, Multidimensional Relationship
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Creation and application of computational and statistical methods for the recognition of patterns in structured and unstructured data such as texts, images and time series.
							<p>Topics: Pattern Recognition in Data Streaming, One-shot-learning, Learning with unbalanced bases, Interpretability of models, Semantic extraction in unstructured data (images, time series, audio, among others), Data treatment for bias removal, Topic discovery (events, subjects) in semi and unstructured data, Information retrieval, Recommendation
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Data and Semantic Treatment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Area responsible for developing methodologies, techniques and methods for data treatment of heterogeneous bases, enriching them semantically.
							<p>Topics: Data management, Semantics, Infra
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
