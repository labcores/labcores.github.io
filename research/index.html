	<p>Area/Scenario: Knowledge Management and Decision Support</p>
	<p>Description: Management and codification of team knowledge to promote greater competitiveness considering available skills, collaborator recognition, as well as optimize and stimulate the development and application of knowledge. From the point of view of decision support, computational support (decision support systems) is considered to promote situational awareness. </p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Inter-organizational knowledge management</li>
		<li>New models of knowledge management</li>
		<li>Strategies for knowledge management in ecosystems (business and academic)</li>
		<li>Situational knowledge support</li>
		<li>Visualization of data as decision support</li>
	</p>
	<p>Area/Scenario: Sensing and Monitoring</p>
	<p>Description: Sector responsible for analyzing data sets of social networks in order to understand phenomena of different domains as to their origin, transmissibility and content, as well as their impact on society. The main elements of a social network are entities (which can represent people, IoT elements, etc.), and the relationships (which can represent relations of friendship, connections etc.) between those entities. </p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Social IoT</li>
		<li>Data origin</li>
		<li>Multiple Source Data</li>
		<li>Semantic Sensor Network</li>
		<li>Rumors Identification</li>
		<li>Multidimensional Relationship</li>
	</p>
	<p>Area/Scenario: Data and Semantic Treatment</p>
	<p>Description: Area responsible for developing methodologies, techniques and methods for data treatment of heterogeneous bases, enriching them semantically. </p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Data management</li>
		<li>Semantics</li>
		<li>Infra</li>
	</p>
	<p>Area/Scenario: Pattern Recognition</p>
	<p>Description: Creation and application of computational and statistical methods for the recognition of patterns in structured and unstructured data such as texts, images and time series.</p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Pattern Recognition in Data Streaming</li>
		<li>One-shot-learning</li>
		<li>Learning with unbalanced bases</li>
		<li>Interpretability of models</li>
		<li>Semantic extraction in unstructured data (images, time series, audio, among others)</li>
		<li>Data treatment for bias removal</li>
		<li>Topic discovery (events, subjects) in semi and unstructured data</li>
		<li>Information retrieval</li>
		<li>Recommendation</li>
	</p>
	<p>Area/Scenario: Urban Centers</p>
	<p>Description: Scenario that characterizes applications and solutions aimed at solving problems and creating facilities in urban centers.</p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Smart Cities</li>
		<li>Crowdsensing</li>
		<li>Opportunistic collaborations(opportunistic sensing, opportunistic networks)</li>
		<li>Urban mobility</li>
	</p>
	<p>Area/Scenario: Science and Academy</p>
	<p>Description: Scenario featuring applications and solutions geared to academia and scientific research. It mainly includes researches focused on analyzing scientific production, technologies and products, as well as the interaction between scenario and society.</p>
	<p>Research Topics: 
		<li>Scientometrics (metrics on science and production)</li>
		<li>Altmetrics (Alternative metrics that aim to quantify other aspects of science, eg impact on the population)</li>
		<li>Tech mining</li>
		<li>Big scholar data (Techniques for application in massive academic data)</li>
	</p>
